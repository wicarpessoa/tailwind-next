# Tailwind-Next Form Study

## Introduction

This repository showcases a form designed primarily as a study project. It's important to note that the form is **not functional**, and the main emphasis has been laid on styling and UI interactions. The journey of constructing this project offered a deep dive into some of the modern web technologies, blending functionality with aesthetics.

## Technologies Used

1. **Next.js**: A React framework offering server-side rendering and generating static websites, which makes it ideal for a performant and SEO-friendly application.
 
2. **RadixUI**: Provides low-level UI primitives to help us build high-quality, accessible design systems without sacrificing style or functionality.

3. **Framer Motion**: A powerful library for animations and interactions in React. It aids in creating fluid visual transitions.

4. **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework, TailwindCSS offers rapid UI development with its vast array of utility classes. It fosters consistency and streamlines the design process.

5. **Auto Animate**: Enhances the user experience by providing seamless animations between UI states without the need for intricate animation configurations.

6. **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript, TypeScript introduces static types. It not only enhances code quality and understandability but also boosts the development experience with better tooling.
